-- PROBLEM SOLVING NOTES


  --UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
    -1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    -2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    -3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    -4. Do I have enough info to solve the problem determined from the inputs?
    -5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are apart of the problem?

  --EXPLORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES
    -coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    -examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
    -1. start w simple examples
    -2. Progress to more complex examples
    -3. Explore examples with empty inputs
    -4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

  --BREAK IT DOWN
    -write down the steps you know you are going to take
    -write psuedo code out in comments for EVERY Step

  --SOLVE/SIMPLIFY
    -solve the problem, if you can't... solve a simpler problem
      -1. find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
      -2. temporarily ignore that difficulty 
      -3. write a simplified solution
      -4. then incorporate that difficulty back in 

  --LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR
    -Can you check the result?
    -Can you derive the result differently?
    -Can you understand it at a glance?
    -Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    -Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    -Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    -How have other people solved this problem?
